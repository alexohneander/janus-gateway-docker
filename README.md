# janus-gateway-docker

This repository provides the Dockerfile to build a full-featured docker image for the Janus WebRTC Server based on Debian bookworm.

Janus is an open source, general purpose, WebRTC server designed and developed by Meetecho. This version of the server is tailored for Linux systems, although it can be compiled for, and installed on, MacOS machines as well. Windows is not supported, but if that's a requirement, Janus is known to work in the "Windows Subsystem for Linux" on Windows 10.

For some online demos and documentations, make sure you pay the project website a visit!

To discuss Janus with us and other users, there's a Google Group called meetecho-janus that you can use. If you encounter bugs, though, please submit an issue on github instead.
